# Crash-course-on-Python-by-google-FINAL-PROJECT-WordCloud-
In this project, we'll create a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. 
The wordcloud module will then generate the image from our dictionary.

For the input text of your script, we will need to provide a file that contains text only. For the text itself, we can copy and paste the contents of a website we like. Or we can use a site like Project Gutenberg to find books that are available online. we could see what word clouds we can get from famous books, like a Shakespeare play or a novel by Jane Austen. Save this as a .txt file somewhere on your computer.

Now we will need to upload our input file here so that our script will be able to process it. To do the upload, we will need an uploader widget. Run the following cell to perform all the installs and imports for your word cloud script and uploader widget. It may take a minute for all of this to run and there will be a lot of output messages. But, be patient. Once you get the following final line of output, the code is done executing.
